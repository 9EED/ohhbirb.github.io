<h2>I'm Alasdair, but online I mostly go via the pseudonym OhhBirb, or Birb for short.
  I pretty much know zero code, some barebones html, javascript and CSS, but other than that I'm useless, but hopefully
  I'll change that at some point. One semi-interesting thing is that me and my buddy Tax planned on making a game at some
  point last year, with a couple of our friends; it didn't pan out. Buuuuut, I'm gonna try and learn how to use something like
  pygame or Unity, so we can make the most basic game imagineable. This site is pretty barebones right now, and this is 
  super early in my planned development for it, but it works haha.
