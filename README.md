Didn't do much

1/8/2022
Did a reasonable amount, mainly revolving around the Cryptid side I'm doing for my brother, added Cryptid.txt and started a page about Subject-Î”, aka Bigfoot.

4/8/2022
Added a new file for Mothman, didn't really do much last few days, and added ways to reach the site without having to know the file names, as well as a main portal to let you access all USDRIP files. Also added Images to Bigfoots file.
